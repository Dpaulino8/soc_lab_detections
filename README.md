# soc_lab_detections

> **TL;DR:** Built a SOC Home Lab to demonstrate my ability to configure a SEIM tool and detect any signs of an intrusion. 

## Problem
What security problem does this solve? (1â€“2 paragraphs)

## Environment
- Tools: <VirtualBox, 
- Data sources: <Windows Security 4624/4625/4688, Sysmon, Zeek conn.log>
- ATT&CK: <TA000x / T10xx>

## What I built
- Three virtual machines running on one computer (Ubuntu (Home), Windows 11 (Monitor), Kali Linux (Attack))
- Feature 2
- Detection rules / queries (link to files)

## How I tested
- Steps (Atomic Red Team command / simulated dataset)
- Expected vs. observed result
- Tuning decisions (noise, false positives)

## Results
- Metrics (alerts caught, FP reduction, mean triage time)
- Screenshots (media/)

## How to run
Commands / docker-compose / setup steps.

## Future work
Short roadmap.
